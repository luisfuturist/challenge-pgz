# Plan

Making a professional indie game involves a structured process, even with a small team. Here's a high-level overview:

## Pre-Production (The Blueprint)

* [x] **Concept:** Define the core idea, genre, and unique selling points.
    * This was brainstormed using AI, especially Gemini and ChatGPT via chats and calls.
    * The result was the item below.
* [x] [**Game Design Document (GDD):**](./notes/gdd.md) Create a living document that details all aspects of the game, including mechanics, story, art style, and target audience.
* [ ] **Prototyping:** Build a small, playable version of the core gameplay loop to test if the idea is fun.
  * This helps to validate the concept early on.

## Production (The Grind)

* [ ] **Development:** Write the code, create/get the art assets, compose/get the music and sound effects.
  * This is the longest phase, where the game is actually built.
* [ ] **Project Management:** Use tools like a backlog to organize tasks and manage the timeline.

## Post-Production (The Polish)

* [ ] **Testing and QA:** Conduct rigorous testing to find and fix bugs, refine gameplay balance, and improve the user experience.
* [ ] **Optimization:** Ensure the game runs smoothly on the target platforms.
* [ ] **Marketing and Promotion:** Build a community, create trailers and promotional materials, and prepare for launch. This effort runs parallel to development and is crucial for visibility.

## Launch & Post-Launch (The Finish Line)

* [ ] **Release:** Distribute the game on platforms like Steam, itch.io, or console stores.
* **Updates and Support:** Continue to fix bugs, release patches, and potentially add new content to keep the community engaged.
