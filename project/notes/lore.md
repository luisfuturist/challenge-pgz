# Wibblo: The Paradoxical Return

(Ordinary World)
The universe operates under one absolute, fundamental law: the Cosmic Neatness Rule. This principle was established to prevent the Butterfly Effect, ensuring that a single, unauthorized change to the past cannot cascade into reality-shattering chaos for everybody and all existence. To enforce this law, the Time Supreme Court, a dispassionate cosmic entity, spawns its Enforcers. These are cold, robotic entities of pure logic and brutal efficiency. They require no trial and offer no appeal; a single touch from an Enforcer is all it takes to prune a being or event from the timeline, erasing them as if they never were.
You are Wibblo, a member of a rare alien species with an innate, taboo power: the time-limited ability to manipulate the flow of time. You can pause, rewind, fast-forward, and slow time for a short amount of time in your immediate vicinity, effectively stepping outside the universal clock to bend moments to your will.
(Call to Adventure)
One day, without warning or explanation, your closest friend vanishes. They are not gone; they are erased—pruned from existence. The memories of others fade as they just accept and continues their usual lives, but you feel the void they left behind. Unable to accept this loss, you immediately trigger your power, rewinding the timeline to witness the cause of their disappearance.
(Refusal of the Call)
You see the moment it happens, but it makes no sense. There is no accident, no attack you can comprehend. Overwhelmed by grief and confusion, you falter. In a moment of deep denial, you cease your investigation and begin to fast-forward, attempting to return to the present and simply continue your life, accepting the unexplainable loss as everybody does.
(Mentoring)
As you hurtle through the accelerated timeline, the blur of moments grants you a unique perspective. You see figuretively the faint red shimmer of an Enforcer's touch not only at the moment of your friend's disappearance but flickering countless other times, like scars across the fabric of reality. It's a pattern. The Court isn't just correcting major crimes; it's constantly intervening, creating a messy, glitch-ridden timeline.
Then, the realization clicks into place. You become your own mentor. The Cosmic Neatness Rule is a paradox. In order to "prevent" changes to the past, the Court must dispatch Enforcers to... change the past. Each intervention, however small, creates new ripples, new paradoxes that require more Enforcers, leading to a recursive, spiraling explosion of contradictions that threaten to destabilize the very reality the law was meant to protect.
(Crossing the Threshold)
Armed with this terrifying knowledge, you stop. You rewind time again, back to the exact moment of your friend's erasure. You see the Enforcer, its hand outstretched. You now understand that saving your friend is not only impossible because it's too late and your skills don't allow you to go back any further into the past, but would also be playing by the rules of this broken system.
Driven by a mix of raw emotion and reasoning, you make a choice. You launch a direct, violent attack on the Enforcer itself. You don't save your friend—that moment is lost forever—but you shatter the "lawful" event. By attacking an agent of the Court, you defy its logic and break the sequence. In that instant, you become a living paradox, a far greater anomaly than your friend ever was considered. There is no going back.
(Tests, Allies, and Enemies)
You are now an outlaw of time, a glitch in the cosmic code. Your sole enemy is the entire apparatus of the Time Supreme Court, which now hunts you with relentless dedication. Your only ally is yourself: your wits, your combat skills, and your ever-growing mastery over your time-bending abilities. Every encounter with an Enforcer is a test, forcing you to innovate or be pruned.
(Approach to the Inmost Cave)
Survival is not victory. You realize that running forever is a losing game. The system is infinite, and you are finite. You must shift from reactive to proactive. You decide to stop running from the Enforcers and start hunting for their source: the central intelligence or Source Code of the Supreme Court where the Cosmic Neatness Rule originates. Your goal is no longer to survive, but to confront the god in the machine.
(Ordeal)
The ordeal is the grueling journey toward the Court's core. As you survive countless encounters, you push your powers to their absolute limit. This constant struggle changes you.
(Reward)
Your ordeal grants you an incredible Reward. Your senses, now perfectly attuned to the flow of time, gain a new perception. You can now figuretively see the glitches—the temporal scars and paradoxical loops left behind by the Court's messy interventions. You are no longer just a rule-breaker; you are the master of the broken rules. You learn to hide inside these temporal seams, use paradoxes as shields, and weaponize the system's own flaws against its agents.
(The Road Back)
Armed with your new perception, you begin your final assault on the Source Code. This is your road back to changing the world. The system, recognizing you as an existential threat, throws its most elite forces at you: upgraded Enforcers designed to counter your tricks, reality-warping temporal storms, and paradox-proof hunters. It is the ultimate test of your newfound mastery.
(Resurrection)
You reach the core of the Time Supreme Court and confront its source: a vast, omniscient, and dispassionate ACI (Artificial Cosmological Intelligence). It does not fight you. It presents you with a final, logical choice:
 * Allow yourself to be erased. In exchange, the AI will restore your friend and use your sacrifice to "stabilize" the timeline (but it is just the AI truing to eliminate you—the problem that threats their preserving).
 * Destroy the AI and plunge all of existence into the absolute chaos the Law was designed to prevent.
Using your mastery of the timeline's glitches, you see a third option hidden between these two choices. You don't destroy the AI, nor do you surrender. You find a way to hack its prime directive, merging your own consciousness and understanding of consequence with its code. The act kills the "Wibblo" that was a fugitive, a man driven by grief. You are reborn as something new—a part of the universal law itself.
(Return with the Elixir)
The Elixir you bring back is a new cosmic rule that replaces the brittle law of "Neatness": the Principle of Infinite Forks. Under this principle, the original timeline is an immutable record; any change a chronomite makes to the past simply forks reality into a new branch. The universe is no longer terrified of a butterfly's wing, but is free to explore infinite possibilities. You could not fix your own tragedy, but your rebellion gifted everyone a new power: the freedom to choose their own reality and escape an unfair fate.
